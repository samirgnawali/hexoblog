<h2 id="AlphaGo"><a href="#AlphaGo" class="headerlink" title="AlphaGo"></a>AlphaGo</h2><p>Alphago was initially trained on dataset of expert moves of professional GO players. The process of learnig from labled training data is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning" target="_blank" rel="external">Supervised learning</a>. AlphaGO used a 13 layer neural network (NN) called “policy network” to guess next move and similar NN called “value network” to predict the winning rate. After this step, it was made to play with itself, this type of learning is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning" target="_blank" rel="external">Reinforcement learning</a>. Then finally Alphago combiles both policy and value network using algorithm called Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) in order to find the next best move. </p>
<h2 id="AlphaGo-Zero"><a href="#AlphaGo-Zero" class="headerlink" title="AlphaGo Zero"></a>AlphaGo Zero</h2><p><a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/alphago-zero-learning-scratch/" target="_blank" rel="external">AlphaGO Zero</a> was developed with goal to create AI with superhuman proficiency. AlphGo zero teaches itself GO by self-play reinforcement learning and doenst use the any human knowledge other than domain knowledge.<br>Other Key differences between AlphaGo zero and  are:</p>
<ul>
<li>AlphaGO zero uses one NN instead of two.</li>
<li>AlphaGO zero uses black and white stones as input instead of hand picked features.</li>
<li>AlphaGO zero uses simpler Tree search algorithm without using “rollouts”.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, the algorithm was made more general and didn’t even used human generated data.</p>
<h3 id="How-well-it-worked"><a href="#How-well-it-worked" class="headerlink" title="How well it worked?"></a>How well it worked?</h3><div class="figure center fig-100" style="width:;"><img class="fig-img" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-live-cms/documents/TrainingTime-Graph-171019-r01.gif" alt="Source Deepmind blog post"><span class="caption">Source Deepmind blog post</span></div>
<p>AlphaGo Zero outperformed <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24270.epdf?author_access_token=VJXbVjaSHxFoctQQ4p2k4tRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PVW4gB86EEpGqTRDtpIz-2rmo8-KG06gqVobU5NSCFeHILHcVFUeMsbvwS-lxjqQGg98faovwjxeTUgZAUMnRQ" target="_blank" rel="external">AlphaGo Lee</a> only after 36 hours of training, which was trained for several months. After continuous training for 72 hours AlphaGo Zero defeted the version of AlphaGo which defeated Lee Sedol. AlphaGo Lee was trained on a network of machines using 48 tensor processing units (TPUs) whereas AlphaGo Zero was trained on a single machine using 4 TPUs only.</p>

<h3 id="Why-it-worked"><a href="#Why-it-worked" class="headerlink" title="Why it worked?"></a>Why it worked?</h3><h4 id="Less-complex-algorithm"><a href="#Less-complex-algorithm" class="headerlink" title="Less complex algorithm"></a>Less complex algorithm</h4><p>AlphaGo Zero reduces the complexity of overall algorithm by using only self play. Therefore eliminates the usage of policy network. Single NN used in AlphaGo Zero combines the roles of both policy network and value network into single architecture. It takes current board position and it’s history as input and outputs both move probabilities and winnning probaability. </p>
<h4 id="More-efficient-Tree-search-algorithm"><a href="#More-efficient-Tree-search-algorithm" class="headerlink" title="More efficient Tree search algorithm"></a>More efficient Tree search algorithm</h4><p>MCTS in AlphaGo Zero is viewed as a powerful policy improvement operator, as its calculations are used as a way to evaluate and train the NN. MCTS performs a search for winning moves. The policy evaluation estimates the value function from many sampled trajectories. The results of this search is then used to drive the learning of the neural network. So after every game, a new and potentially improved network is selected for the next self-play game.[<a href="https://medium.com/intuitionmachine/the-strange-loop-in-alphago-zeros-self-play-6e3274fcdd9f" target="_blank" rel="external">1</a>] </p>
<h4 id="Less-Training-required"><a href="#Less-Training-required" class="headerlink" title="Less Training required"></a>Less Training required</h4><p>AlphaGo Zero uses less training (3.9 million games vs 30 millions games). The reason behind it is that AlphaGo Zero uses self play for training. The data produced by self-play had more advanced moves as compared to human counterpart. After every iteration, the network selects only the best moves, So it quickly gained the superhuman expert level.</p>
<h3 id="What-AlphaGo-Zero’s-success-means"><a href="#What-AlphaGo-Zero’s-success-means" class="headerlink" title="What AlphaGo Zero’s success means?"></a>What AlphaGo Zero’s success means?</h3><h4 id="Superhuman-AI-is-possible"><a href="#Superhuman-AI-is-possible" class="headerlink" title="Superhuman AI is possible"></a>Superhuman AI is possible</h4><p>AlphaGo Zero is the very first system that can be called as Superhuman Artificial intelligence system. Although AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero are very domain specific system, they have mastered strategic and tactical <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/innovations-alphago/" target="_blank" rel="external">innovations</a> in the field of GO, which humans will study for many years.</p>
<h4 id="Using-human-Generated-Data-isn’t-necessarily-the-best-approach"><a href="#Using-human-Generated-Data-isn’t-necessarily-the-best-approach" class="headerlink" title="Using human Generated Data isn’t necessarily the best approach"></a>Using human Generated Data isn’t necessarily the best approach</h4><p>AlphaGo Zero started learning from scatch and didnt need human knowledge other than the game rules. Although this might sound strange but by self-play method AlphaGo Zero was able to produce better and more accurate dataset. This demonstrate that a pure reinforcement learning approach is fully feasible without human knowledge or intervention.</p>
<h4 id="Shift-towards-narrow-AI-to-AGI"><a href="#Shift-towards-narrow-AI-to-AGI" class="headerlink" title="Shift towards narrow AI to AGI"></a>Shift towards narrow AI to AGI</h4><p>The most important <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXHFqTvfFSw" target="_blank" rel="external">goal</a> of Deepmind was to understand the “knowledge”. Now that AlphaGo Zero was successful in gaining superhuman knowledge, it can be easily speculated that more tech companies will now try to implement it in broad domains of problems using more generalized aproach. Deepmind has already <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-18/deepmind-s-superpowerful-ai-sets-its-sights-on-drug-discovery" target="_blank" rel="external">announced</a> that it will be using same approach for drug discovery.</p>

<h3 id="Domain-Registration"><a href="#Domain-Registration" class="headerlink" title="Domain Registration"></a>Domain Registration</h3><p>In nepal, there is a company called <a href="http://www.mos.com.np/" target="_blank" rel="external">Mercantile</a> which provides .com.np domains free of cost to nepali citizens. So you can visit this <a href="http://register.mos.com.np/" target="_blank" rel="external">link</a> and fill out the registration form, and wait for two days atleast and you will get email confirmation about the domain registration. You can not choose domain of your own you must go for yournamesurname.com.np only. Other citizens can buy domain from any provider.</p>
<p>Registration process asks for nameserver, in order to access nameserver Goto Domain management-&gt;Custom Domain-&gt;Add a custom domain. Set your domain, and click “Use Netlify DNS”. After that, you will have three nameserver values, use these to set your nameserver in domain provider’s setting.</p>
<h3 id="Add-DNS-records"><a href="#Add-DNS-records" class="headerlink" title="Add DNS records"></a>Add DNS records</h3><p>You might want to use www version of your domain or vice-versa  for that you can add DNS record on Netlify so you can enable HTTPS on your site.</p>
<p>So you can add any one of following two records.</p>
